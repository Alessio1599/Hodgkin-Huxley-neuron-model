# Hodgkin-Huxley-neuron-model
The Hodgkin-Huxley (H.H.) studies of the action potential, published 60 years ago, are a central pillar of modern neuroscience research, ranging from molecular investigations of the structural basis of ion channel function to the computational implications at circuit level. The H.H. model is based on the observation that the electrical activity of neurons  can be explained by the flow of ions across the nerve cell membrane.
